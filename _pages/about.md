I am a first-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/">Hao Su</a>. I previously completed my M.S. in the same department under his supervision. Prior to UC San Diego, I earned my B.S. in Software Engineering from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, where I interned at <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">IIIS</a> worked with Prof. <a href="https://yang-gao.weebly.com/">Yang Gao</a>.

My research topics include Computer Vision and Embodied AI. Specifically, I am interested in enabling the AI agents to sense, understand and operate in there environments efficiently and robustly.
